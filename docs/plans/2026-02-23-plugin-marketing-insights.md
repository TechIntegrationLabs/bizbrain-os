## Core Positioning Lines

### The Compound Interest of AI Context

> "Every session deposits context. Every future session withdraws it. **The compound interest of AI context.**"

This is the central metaphor. BizBrain OS is a savings account for AI knowledge. Most AI tools start from zero every time. BizBrain compounds.

### Superpowers vs BizBrain

> "Superpowers makes Claude better at **coding**. BizBrain OS makes Claude better at **knowing you**."

Clean differentiation from the most popular Claude Code plugin. Not competing — complementary. Superpowers optimizes the tool. BizBrain optimizes the context.

### The Context Layer

> "The context layer that teaches AI your business."

Already the tagline. Reaffirmed by the plugin design — this is literally what the SessionStart hook does. It teaches Claude who you are, what you're building, and who you're building it for.

## Feature-Level Insights

### The Brain Folder

> "Your AI knowledge isn't locked in an app. It's a folder you can browse, back up, and own."

Key differentiator from every SaaS AI tool. Your data is files on your machine. No vendor lock-in. No subscription cliff where you lose everything.

> "Open `~/bizbrain-os/` in Finder. There's your business. Every client, every project, every decision — organized, searchable, and yours."

### The Initial Scan

> "Install the plugin. It scans your machine. In 60 seconds, Claude knows your projects, your stack, your clients, and your tools. It's like onboarding a new team member — except this one reads 10,000 files in a minute."

The scan is the "wow" moment. Users will share this experience.

> "No forms. No onboarding wizard with 47 questions. BizBrain reads your computer and figures it out."

### The Learning Flywheel

> "Session 1: Claude asks who Tim is. Session 20: Claude already has Tim's project history, open action items, and preferred communication style. That's the flywheel."

Concrete example sells better than abstract concept.

> "Most AI tools have amnesia. BizBrain OS has memory."

Simple. Punchy. True.

### Entity Watchdog

> "Mention a client in conversation. BizBrain updates their record. Mention a deadline. BizBrain adds an action item. You don't manage your CRM — your conversations do."

The magic of background intelligence. CRM that writes itself.

### Profiles

> "Are you a developer? A consultant? A content creator? BizBrain activates the right features automatically. No configuration required."

> "One plugin. Every knowledge worker. From indie devs to agency owners."

### Session Resilience

> "Close your terminal. Walk away. Slam your laptop shut. BizBrain already saved everything. It doesn't need you to click 'end session.'"

Real-world reliability. Users will appreciate this because they've lost context in other tools.

## Comparison Angles

### vs. Notion / Obsidian / Other PKM

> "Notion is where you organize what you already know. BizBrain OS captures what you don't even realize you're learning."

> "You don't write in BizBrain. You work. BizBrain writes itself."

### vs. ChatGPT Memory

> "ChatGPT remembers that you like Python. BizBrain OS knows your five active projects, their tech stacks, your client relationships, open action items across all of them, and that Tim from Disruptors Media prefers Friday check-ins."

Depth of context, not just preferences.

### vs. Custom Instructions / System Prompts

> "You could spend an hour writing the perfect system prompt. Or install BizBrain and let it generate one from your actual work — and keep it updated automatically."

### vs. Starting Every Session Fresh

> "Without BizBrain: 'Let me explain my project structure again...'
> With BizBrain: 'Check on BuildTrack.' → Claude already knows."

The before/after is the strongest sales pitch.

## Audience-Specific Hooks

### For Developers

> "Your repos, your stack, your git history — BizBrain maps it all. Every Claude Code session starts with full project awareness."

> "GSD workflow built in. Plan phases. Execute in waves. Ship faster."

### For Consultants

> "Every client meeting, every decision, every action item — captured and organized. Your AI assistant remembers every engagement."

### For Content Creators

> "From blog drafts to social campaigns to publishing pipelines. BizBrain turns Claude into your content team."

### For Agency Owners

> "Manage clients, projects, contracts, and timesheets from your terminal. BizBrain OS is the agency OS you didn't know you needed."

### For Everyone

> "If you use a computer to build or manage anything, BizBrain OS makes Claude Code your copilot — not just for code, but for everything."

## Launch Narrative Arc

1. **Problem**: Every AI session starts from zero. You re-explain your projects, your clients, your preferences. Every. Single. Time.
2. **Agitation**: You're paying for intelligence but getting amnesia. The smartest AI in the world can't remember what you told it yesterday.
3. **Solution**: BizBrain OS — a Claude Code plugin that builds a persistent knowledge brain from your actual work. It scans your machine, learns from every conversation, and compounds context over time.
4. **Proof**: Show the before/after. Session 1 vs Session 20. The flywheel in action.
5. **CTA**: `claude plugin add bizbrain-os` — one command, forever smarter.
