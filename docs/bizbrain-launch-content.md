## Core Positioning

**One-liner:** BizBrain OS is the context layer that teaches AI your business.

**Elevator pitch (30 seconds):**
Every AI tool you use -- ChatGPT, Claude, OpenClaw, Cursor -- is brilliant at general tasks. But ask about *your* business, and it starts from zero. Every session. Every time. BizBrain OS fixes that permanently. It builds a structured knowledge layer that captures your clients, projects, decisions, and workflows, then feeds that context to any AI tool. The result: AI that actually knows your business and gets smarter every day.

**Why it matters (the hook):**
AI can only be as helpful as it knows the nuances of your business. The bottleneck is not AI intelligence. It is AI ignorance about you.

## Key Messaging Pillars

### 1. Context is the moat
- "AI can only be as helpful as it knows the nuances of your business."
- Every AI tool has the same limitation: it does not know your clients, your workflows, or your preferences.
- BizBrain OS solves this permanently by building a structured context layer.
- Your AI context layer will be the most valuable digital asset your business owns within 2-5 years.

### 2. It compounds over time
- Day 1: AI knows your clients, projects, and basic preferences.
- Month 1: Historical decisions, resolved issues, and proven approaches are captured.
- Month 6: AI drafts content in your voice and anticipates client needs.
- Year 2: A competitor starting today is two years behind. Their context starts from scratch.
- The earlier you start, the wider the gap becomes.

### 3. BizBrain + OpenClaw = AI Employee
- BizBrain OS is the Brain. OpenClaw is the Hands.
- BizBrain knows your clients, projects, history, and workflows.
- OpenClaw sends messages, executes commands, automates browsers, and takes real action.
- Together: an autonomous AI employee that knows your business and gets things done.
- BizBrain works standalone too -- it pairs with any AI tool, not just OpenClaw.

### 4. Local-first, open source
- Your business context is your competitive moat. It lives on your machine, not in someone else's cloud.
- Zero monthly cost. AGPL v3. Fork it, extend it, own it.
- Updates via `git pull` -- your data and config are never touched.

## Social Media Copy

### Twitter/X - Launch Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Every AI tool you use has the same problem:

It knows nothing about your business.

Every session starts from zero. Every time.

We built BizBrain OS to fix this permanently.

Open source. Local-first. Compounding daily.

A thread:

**Tweet 2:**
The bottleneck is not AI intelligence.

It is AI ignorance about you.

Your clients. Your workflows. Your decisions. Your preferences.

BizBrain OS captures all of it into a structured context layer that any AI tool can understand.

**Tweet 3:**
And it compounds.

Day 1: AI knows your clients and projects.
Month 1: Historical decisions are captured.
Month 6: AI drafts in your voice.
Year 2: A competitor starting today is two years behind.

The earlier you start, the wider the gap.

**Tweet 4:**
If you use OpenClaw (or ClawdBot), this is the missing piece.

BizBrain = The Brain (knows your business)
OpenClaw = The Hands (takes action)
Together = An AI employee

BizBrain provides the knowledge that makes autonomous agents actually useful for YOUR business.

**Tweet 5:**
27 modules. Zero monthly cost. Runs on your machine.

- CRM & entity tracking
- Project management (GSD system)
- Time tracking & billing
- Content generation
- GitHub, Notion, Slack, Stripe integrations
- Voice-first setup (5-minute interview)

All feeding the context layer.

**Tweet 6:**
Setup takes 5 minutes:

1. git clone
2. Open start.html
3. Copy the setup prompt
4. Paste into Claude Code
5. Have a conversation about your business

That is it. Claude builds your entire Brain from the conversation.

**Tweet 7:**
Your AI context layer will be the most valuable digital asset your business owns within 5 years.

It compounds every day. Businesses that start building now will have an insurmountable advantage.

BizBrain OS makes it easy to start today.

### LinkedIn Post

**The most valuable business asset you will own in 5 years is not your code, your brand, or your customer list.**

It is your AI context layer.

Every AI tool you use -- ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, OpenClaw -- has the same fundamental limitation: it does not know your business. Every session starts from zero. Your AI assistant is brilliant at general tasks but clueless about your specific clients, workflows, decisions, and preferences.

This is the bottleneck. Not AI intelligence. AI ignorance about you.

We built BizBrain OS to solve this permanently.

It is an open-source, local-first system that builds a structured knowledge layer capturing everything about your business: clients, projects, decisions, historical context, brand voice, workflows. Then it feeds that context to any AI tool you use.

The key insight: it compounds. Month 6 is exponentially more valuable than Month 1. Year 2 is a moat your competitors cannot cross.

If you are a solopreneur, freelancer, agency owner, or startup founder, the best time to start building your AI context layer was a year ago. The second best time is today.

27 modules. Zero monthly cost. Your data stays on your machine.

### Reddit Post (r/ClaudeAI, r/SideProject, r/Entrepreneur)

**Title:** I built an open-source "context layer" for AI -- it teaches Claude (or any AI) your business so every session does not start from scratch

**Body:**

I kept running into the same problem: every time I started a new Claude Code session, I had to re-explain my clients, my project structure, my preferences. The AI was brilliant at coding but clueless about my business.

So I built BizBrain OS -- a structured context layer that captures everything about your business and feeds it to any AI tool.

**What it does:**
- Captures client relationships, project history, decisions, workflows
- Auto-archives every Claude Code conversation
- 27 configurable modules (CRM, time tracking, project management, content generation, etc.)
- Guided 5-minute setup via conversational interview
- Works with OpenClaw/ClawdBot as the "brain" that gives autonomous agents business context

**What makes it different:**
- Local-first -- all data stays on your machine
- Compounds over time -- Month 6 is 10x more valuable than Day 1
- Not "AI features bolted on" -- every module is built to feed and consume the context layer
- Zero monthly cost, AGPL v3

**Who it is for:**
Solopreneurs, freelancers, agencies, consultancies, small startups -- anyone who wants their AI tools to actually understand their business instead of starting from zero every time.

Setup: `git clone`, open `start.html`, copy the setup prompt, paste into Claude Code. It interviews you about your business and builds everything automatically.

Would love feedback. What modules would you want to see?

## Video Script - 90-Second Explainer

**[0:00 - Hook]**
Every AI tool you use has a blind spot. It knows nothing about your business.

**[0:05 - Problem]**
You open Claude Code. You explain your project. You list your clients. You describe your workflow.

Next session? Start over. From scratch.

**[0:15 - Agitate]**
The problem is not AI intelligence. It is AI ignorance about you. Your clients. Your preferences. Your history. All of it, lost between sessions.

**[0:25 - Solution]**
BizBrain OS fixes this. Permanently.

It is an open-source context layer that captures everything about your business -- clients, projects, decisions, workflows -- into a structured system that any AI tool can understand.

**[0:40 - Compound]**
And here is the thing: it compounds.

Day 1, your AI knows your clients and projects.
Month 6, it drafts content in your voice.
Year 2, a competitor starting today is two years behind.

**[0:55 - OpenClaw]**
If you use OpenClaw or ClawdBot, BizBrain OS is the missing piece.

BizBrain is the Brain. OpenClaw is the Hands. Together: an AI employee that knows your business and gets things done.

**[1:05 - How]**
Setup takes five minutes. Clone the repo. Open start.html. Copy the setup prompt. Paste it into Claude Code.

Claude interviews you about your business and builds your entire Brain from the conversation.

**[1:20 - CTA]**
27 modules. Zero monthly cost. Your data stays on your machine.

Your AI context layer will be the most valuable digital asset your business owns in five years.
